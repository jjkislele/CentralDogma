My first stack

## About me
Greeting, It's nice to meet you!
I am an undergraduate student from the school of Information Science and Technology. 
Since I've studied the UNIX course, my professor introduced the 'GIT' and asked me to sign in github.com, and so on, created my first github's stack.
Anyway, at least do not let my account seemes so empty. : )
